# Overview
This project introduces infectious diseases, exemplifying with cases like COVID-19, and explores the Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) mathematical model for epidemic dynamics. Assumptions of the SIR model are outlined, emphasizing factors like infection rates and transitions between states

# Key Features
Euler's Method Implementation: Implemented Euler's method, a numerical technique, to forecast the pandemic's progression. This method allows for practical and iterative calculations of the system's behavior over time.

Visualization with Python: Employed Python's plotting capabilities to create visual representations, offering a clear trajectory of the pandemic's evolution based on the estimated model constants.
